#Siege of Avalon : Open Source#

Siege of Avalon : Open Source is an attempt to keep this great isometric RPG game alive by continuing development on it. Our aim is to create a SDL version of the engine that will work on Win32, Linux and where ever Pascal compilers and SDL are supported.

This is a fork from the CartBlanche repository with an eye on getting things "fixed" enough to keep to the original thinking of the game since the entire episode set is available on GoG for download.  The other reason for the "fork" is to provide a sort of "safe" spot to grab the codebase under the PROPER license of LGPL 2.0 as indicated in the headers from the SourceForge bit-rotted CVS drop.
